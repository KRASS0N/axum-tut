	<h1>You Will Never Do Anything (Here's Why!)</h1>
	<h3>Written at 2 AM on a Monday</h3>

	University was a huge waste of time. I realized that early on, and that's one of the few realizations in my life that I continue to pat myself on the back for. However, what I do not pat myself on the back for is realizing that and then proceeding to do jack shit. I was too busy "learning" Japanese (I'd put 70% certainty that I got farther than you did) and getting shitfaced off cheap alcohol.<br><br>

	All of my hobbies involved some form of consumption. Buying game consoles, buying food, buying electronics to mod the game consoles, buying tools to cook the food faster, buying software to produce music, buying other people's music to inspire my music... okay you get the point. If you had run into me during that time, I would've gone on and on about how excited I was to fuck around with my new Gameboy flash cartridge or watch some anime without subtitles or whatever and you'd think that wow, this engineering student really knows how to keep his gnoggin joggin in between his internships, classes, actual work that contributes to society, etc. I feel like that's the assumption that lots of people make when they hear about someone's dumbass hobbies. For some people, that dumbass hobby is their entire life and they end up working at a gas station or whatever after they graduate, but one would assume that I at least had some potential cause I was a mystical tech wiz guy.<br><br>

	WELL my hypothetical friend, you are dumb as fuck!<br><br>

	The reality is, nothing in this world matters but money. Don't believe me? Think about what would happen if you magically got a billion dollars in your bank account. You could only ever take out like $10k a month, but you never have to work for it ever. How much of your life would change? What would you be doing right now?<br><br>

	The thing is, by existing, you are spending money. Food costs money, water costs money, clean oxygen costs money, computers cost money, electricity costs money, and guess what? It cost a whole lot of money for you to be born. From the moment of conception, you have been spending money. Money is more important than anything in your life. It's more important than all your friends, your family, your fulfillment, your ideals, your opinions, and especially your "mental health." Money is more important than anything else that will ever exist because it is the means that give you access to the very bare minimum you need to live. Without that bare minimum, you just borrow from the others who have money and eventually you just die. And it'll cost a whole lot to clean up the leftovers, so try not to make too much of a mess when you do it.<br><br>

	It's easy to get sucked into this romantic idea where you learn how to do something really complicated and go against the grain and fellate yourself over how unusual and interesting your life is. It's easy to see someone sell their soul running Windows just to bitch and complain about it every day while you run on Arch Linux or Gentoo or whatever and spend the time to learn each and every setting until it is prefectly configured to do exactly what you want. You may even put an ad blocker on your browser and turn your nose up at your professor whenever they broadcast a commercial for the latest Honda Civic before they play a YouTube video about project management. Your phone's jailbroken and you never have to worry about those pesky updates that drain the battery twice as fast for no reason. You bought a VPN and now you never have to worry about paying for Netflix ever again.<br><br>

	The Matrix is real, and you logged out of it. Look at all these dumb consumers! Look at all these normies that know less than me. I'm set, I know how the world works, and I made it my own. I know what I'm doing. I have strong ideals. I never waste my time on anything I am ideologically opposed to. I look down on those who do. I make my own choices, and wherever my life goes, it's where I want it.<br><br>

	I ignore my peers because they are not valuable to me. I will never connect with them. I will never understand spending all my time doom scrolling on TikTok, Instagram, Twitter (I'm not calling that shit X), etc. and because of that I will not understand all the new turns of phrase, the new dramas, and the new funny memes they'll reference and I won't get. I won't be able to talk about any of my favorite movies or Netflix shows because I do not watch them. I physically cannot stomach watching them. I recognize immediately that they are dumb, worthless art and a waste of time. I see "programmer humor" and "programmer memes" online and the brief exposure is so cringy it makes me want to find out where the uploader lives, break into their house, and irreversibly damage their modem and all the electric cables in the walls so they can never post them again.<br><br>

	Did you find all that relatable? Well, buckle up kiddo, cause I'm gonna give you a little taste of where you're about to end up.<br><br>

	No one actually gives a fuck about any of your abilities. Your skills do not matter in any capacity. Your hobbies? Even less. Your goals and ambition are amusement at best. Your opinions are worthless. Your endless drive and passion to learn and create and tell everyone about what you're doing will be met with blank stares. Assuming you're not making any money, that is.<br><br>

	People do not care what you can do. They care about what they can understand. Money is easy to understand. It's a number. It's either big, or it's small. If you have nothing to say about any of the work you do, but you make a ton of money, then you are skilled. If you can ramble about every single component of your computer and what they do and how you manipulated them with years of experience and drive to do exactly what you want, but your money number is small, then you are a fraud. You are no different than someone with a PhD in Underwater Basket Weaving rambling about their latest essay. You are worthless slime that contributes nothing to society. Your skills are not needed. No one cares how complicated they are, or how "smart" you are, or what you believe in. In fact, they literally do not know any of the issues that you are so opposed to exist. They think you're strange and obsessive for even noticing them in the first place. And what's worse? You had the audacity to waste everyone's time talking about them. Maybe next time, you could talk about a Netflix show or something.<br><br>

	If you're reading this, it means that something worked out for me. But chances are, it won't for you. You're gonna program the script-heavy website that steals people's data to personalize ads. You're gonna program the AI chatbot that pops up in the corner and blinks until the user clicks on it. You're gonna program the new way that YouTube gets around ad blockers. You're gonna program the software updates that make people buy new phones because their batteries keep running out. You're gonna progam the popup that forces them to install the updates. You're gonna program the algorithms that keep people staring at TikTok the longest. You're gonna program the algorithm that eventually locks them out of their account until they type in their phone number. And then you'll program the algorithm that distributes that data to spam call centers in a timely manner.<br><br>

	And if you're not doing that, but someone else is, then their work is more important than yours. They're getting paid more, too. A whole lot more. After all, there's a whole lot of salaries higher than $0.<br><br>
